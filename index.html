            <blockquote>
                <p class="quotetext">"Our architectural heritage is a unique resource, an
                    irreplaceable expression of the richness and diversity
                    of our past. Structures and places can, over time,
                    acquire character and special interest through their
                    intrinsic quality, continued existence and familiarity.
                    The built heritage consists not only of great artistic
                    achievements, but also of the everyday works of
                    craftsmen. In a changing world, these structures
                    have a cultural significance which we may recognise
                    for the first time only when individual structures are
                    lost or threatened. As we enjoy this inheritance, we
                    should ensure it is conserved in order to pass it on
                    to our successors."</p>

                    <p>Awareness of our shared heritage is crucial to ensuring its continued survival, but it is frequently
                        the case that people do not know about the history of their local areas, often passing by historical
                        sites on their own doorsteps.

                        Even for those who want to learn, it can be difficult to know where to
                        start or to access information without becoming overwhelmed. A number of organisations run out-reach
                        and heritage education programmes with schools, but resources can be limited.

                        This website is intended to illustrate a template for engaging second-level students with the history of their local areas. While the
                        quizzes on this website relate to Dublin City, the model for the website can be adapted to any area, regardless
                        of scale. The quizzes are intended to get students thinking about the development of their local areas as a
                        first step towards deeper engagement with heritage.

                        <h4>John Speed's 'Map of Dubline'</h4>
                        <p>John Speed's 'Map of Dubline' of 1610 is the oldest surviving map of Dublin City, this version of the map being a reprint of 1896.
                            The map was included in John Speed's atlas 'The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine' published in 1611. Speed likely never visited
                            Ireland so this map was probably put together from other sources, perhaps older maps, which have since been lost.

                            As well as Dublin Castle (construction began in 1204), St Patrick's Cathedral (then still St Patrick's Church, originally constructed
                            between 1220 and 1259) and St Michan's Church (established in 1085 and rebuilt in 1685), there are many famous Dublin sites shown on the map.
                            These include Trinity College (founded 1592), Christchurch (founded around 1030) and Dublin's City walls (parts of which still remain,
                            such as the sections near St Audoen's Church). King's Inns, which was established 1541 and shown as 'the Innes', was located on the site
                            of the existing Four Courts on Speed's Map (it later moved to its current location on Constitution Hill during the 1790s). Speed's map also
                            shows that the layout of several streets has largely survived to this day, included Wood Quay, Fishamble Street, Winetavern Street,
                            Merchant's Quay, Dame Street, South Great George's Street, Thomas Street and St James Gate.
