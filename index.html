                        <h4>John Speed's 'Map of Dubline'</h4>
                        <p>John Speed's 'Map of Dubline' of 1610 is the oldest surviving map of Dublin City, this version of the map being a reprint of 1896.
                            The map was included in John Speed's atlas 'The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine' published in 1611. Speed likely never visited
                            Ireland so this map was probably put together from other sources, perhaps older maps, which have since been lost.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As well as Dublin Castle (construction began in 1204), St Patrick's Cathedral (then still St Patrick's Church, originally constructed
                            between 1220 and 1259) and St Michan's Church (established in 1085 and rebuilt in 1685), there are many famous Dublin sites shown on the map.
                            These include Trinity College (founded 1592), Christchurch (founded around 1030) and Dublin's City walls (parts of which still remain,
                            such as the sections near St Audoen's Church). King's Inns, which was established 1541 and shown as 'the Innes', was located on the site
                            of the existing Four Courts on Speed's Map (it later moved to its current location on Constitution Hill during the 1790s). Speed's map also
                            shows that the layout of several streets has largely survived to this day, included Wood Quay, Fishamble Street, Winetavern Street,
                            Merchant's Quay, Dame Street, South Great George's Street, Thomas Street and St James Gate.
